This is a tomato counter (see http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/ for more details how pomodoro techinque works).
It's a pre-release so it's not perfeclty working (i.e. it does not constains prerequisite for dependencies so you must supply them by hand).

It depends upon


DateTime::Duration
DateTime::Format::Duration


so before use this program install them by

cpan -i DateTime::Duration
cpan -i DateTime::Format::Duration
